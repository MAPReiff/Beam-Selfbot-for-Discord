# Beam Announcement Selfbot
Here is a very simple and easy to use method to announce your beam stream in any server.

After setting up the bot, simply type `beam.live BEAM_NAME` into the discord chat of your choice, and a fancy message will popup with all your stream details preloaded in the message! If you want automatic announcements, go checkout [M8 Bot](https://github.com/MAPReiff/M8-Bot)!

Setup:
* [Download Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Download the bot from the releases page
* Get your discord user token by opening beam in your browser, pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+I`. On the new popup, go to the `Aplication` tab. Under `Storage`, then `LoaclStorage` you will see a `token` row. Copy that token, you will need it later.
* In discord, enable developer settings. You can find this in the `Apperance` tab of discord's settings. With this enabled, go to any chat message you sent, right click on your icon, and click `Copy ID`. You will need this later.
